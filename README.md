# About the Project.

Calculator is a web application built during an exercise proposed in one of the courses I completed.

The application consists of performing calculations and copying the result to the clipboard, with the option of light and dark themes for better visibility.

The project was developed using the JavaScript programming language, in addition to HTML and CSS.
